Hi, for my groupmates.

You will be making a receipt function. Note that this is a VOID function, so it will not return a value. Here are the guidelines.

1. Header Formatting: Ensure the header section includes the restaurant name ("ARDEE'S CANTEEN"), the current date and time (utilizing the orderTime variable), the location ("San Antonio, Nueva Ecija"), and contact information ("+63902020202"). Maintain the same formatting and spacing as shown in the provided code.

2. Order Details: Iterate through the orderCart, quantityAmount, and price arrays to print each item along with its quantity and price. Use setw() for proper alignment and consistency in formatting. Include a section label ("DINE IN-" or "TAKE OUT") based on the value of the dine variable.

3. Total Calculation: Calculate the total amount by summing up the prices of all ordered items. Optionally, consider adding VAT calculation if applicable, as shown in the code.

4.  Final Summary: Display the total quantity of items ordered along with the subtotal, taxes (if applicable), and final total. Ensure all amounts are formatted correctly and aligned neatly.

5. Footer Section: Include a thank-you message ("Thank you, please come again") and any additional information required for an official receipt, such as customer details ("Sold to:", "Name:", "Address:", "TIN:").

6.  Dynamic Content: Utilize dynamic variables like orderTime and dine to personalize the receipt based on the current order and dining option.
